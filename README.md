## Product Alert Assistance using ProQRuct 🚨

### Inspiration 💡

Our project is at the intersection of **healthcare and sustainability**. Recognizing the need to address issues related to **food safety and wastage**, we embarked on a journey to develop a solution that not only safeguards health but also promotes environmental conservation.

### What it does 🧠

Our project serves a dual purpose: 
- It tackles healthcare concerns by **preventing the consumption of expired products**, thus reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses.
- It also promotes sustainability through the efficient utilization of resources. Through an **alert system implemented via email**, users are notified about impending product expiry dates, enabling them to consume items promptly and minimize wastage.

### How we built it 🛠️

Leveraging a tech stack comprising **React, Tailwind CSS,** and **NodeJS**, coupled with the power of **Google Cloud** and **Firebase**, we crafted an intuitive solution that simplifies the monitoring of product expiry dates. Our approach involved meticulous planning, seamless integration of frontend and backend components, and rigorous testing to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Challenges we ran into 💪🏼

Throughout the development process, we faced several hurdles, including issues during backend deployment and batch job deployment. Ensuring seamless integration and synchronization of data across multiple platforms posed significant challenges. Additionally, guaranteeing real-time alerts and optimizing performance required innovative problem-solving, collaboration among team members, and a steadfast commitment to delivering a robust solution.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆

We are proud to have successfully implemented cron batch jobs for the first time, enabling automated triggers for data retrieval and processing using NodeJS. This achievement, coupled with our effective alert system, reflects our dedication to empowering users to proactively manage their consumption habits for healthier living and environmental sustainability. Moreover, our user-friendly interface and seamless backend integration underscore our commitment to meeting the diverse needs of our users.
