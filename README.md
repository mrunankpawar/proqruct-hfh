## Product Alert Assistance using ProQRuct üö®

### Inspiration üí°

Our project is at the intersection of **healthcare and sustainability**. Recognizing the need to address issues related to **food safety and wastage**, we embarked on a journey to develop a solution that not only safeguards health but also promotes environmental conservation.

### What it does üß†

Our project serves a dual purpose: 
- It tackles healthcare concerns by **preventing the consumption of expired products**, thus reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses.
- It also promotes sustainability through the efficient utilization of resources. Through an **alert system implemented via email**, users are notified about impending product expiry dates, enabling them to consume items promptly and minimize wastage.
